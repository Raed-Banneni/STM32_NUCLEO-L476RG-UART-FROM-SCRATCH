# STM32-user-led-from-scratch 
 uart rx/tx driver from scratch 
 the main goal is to turn the user led with a serial msg typed by pc's keybord and sent to the board via usart2 port (without enabling the clock so it bcomes asynchronous)
 if the serial msg is the 'o' charachter the led will be on otherwise it will be off.
*****************
You'll find the code in "Src" folder, the uart.h header file is in the "Inc"folder.
